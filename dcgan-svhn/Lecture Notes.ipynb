    "# Deep Convolutional GANs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll build a GAN using convolutional layers in the generator and discriminator. This is called a Deep Convolutional GAN, or DCGAN for short. The DCGAN architecture was first explored in 2016 and has seen impressive results in generating new images; you can read the [original paper, here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be training DCGAN on the [Street View House Numbers](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/) (SVHN) dataset. These are color images of house numbers collected from Google street view. SVHN images are in color and much more variable than MNIST. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='assets/svhn_dcgan.png' width=80% />\n",
    "\n",
    "So, our goal is to create a DCGAN that can generate new, realistic-looking images of house numbers. We'll go through the following steps to do this:\n",
    "* Load in and pre-process the house numbers dataset\n",
    "* Define discriminator and generator networks\n",
    "* Train these adversarial networks\n",
    "* Visualize the loss over time and some sample, generated images\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deeper Convolutional Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this dataset is more complex than our MNIST data, we'll need a deeper network to accurately identify patterns in these images and be able to generate new ones. Specifically, we'll use a series of convolutional or transpose convolutional layers in the discriminator and generator. It's also necessary to use batch normalization to get these convolutional networks to train. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides these changes in network structure, training the discriminator and generator networks should be the same as before. That is, the discriminator will alternate training on real and fake (generated) images, and the generator will aim to trick the discriminator into thinking that its generated images are real!"

    "\n",
    "Here you'll build the discriminator. This is a convolutional classifier like you've built before, only without any maxpooling layers. \n",
    "* The inputs to the discriminator are 32x32x3 tensor images\n",
    "* You'll want a few convolutional, hidden layers\n",
    "* Then a fully connected layer for the output; as before, we want a sigmoid output, but we'll add that in the loss function, [BCEWithLogitsLoss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#bcewithlogitsloss), later\n",

    "\n",
    "You'll also want to use batch normalization with [nn.BatchNorm2d](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#batchnorm2d) on each layer **except** the first convolutional layer and final, linear output layer. \n",

    "#### Helper `conv` function \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, each layer should look something like convolution > batch norm > leaky ReLU, and so we'll define a function to put these layers together. This function will create a sequential series of a convolutional + an optional batch norm layer. We'll create these using PyTorch's [Sequential container](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#sequential), which takes in a list of layers and creates layers according to the order that they are passed in to the Sequential constructor.\n",

    "* Then, we use batch normalization and a leaky ReLU activation. \n",
    "* Next is a series of [transpose convolutional layers](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#convtranspose2d), where you typically halve the depth and double the width and height of the previous layer. \n",
